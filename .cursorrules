# AmpX Modbus Project Intelligence

## Memory Bank
- Remember to read the entire Memory Bank at the start of each session
- Update activeContext.md and progress.md after each significant development milestone
- Follow the established hierarchy when updating documentation
- Maintain clear relationships between all documentation files

## Project Patterns
- This is an ESP32-based Modbus TCP/IP server implementation
- The project is focused on industrial audio amplification equipment
- Documentation follows a structured approach with the Memory Bank system

## User Preferences
- Prefer step-by-step approaches when implementing new features
- Test each component before proceeding to the next stage
- Maintain comprehensive documentation of all implementation decisions

## Implementation Guidelines
- Follow C++ best practices for embedded systems
- Prioritize memory efficiency and response time in implementations
- Consider error handling at all levels of the architecture
- Use clear and consistent naming conventions

## Learning Focus
- As the project develops, document key insights and patterns in this file
- Track rationale for technical decisions
- Maintain notes on implementation challenges and solutions

This file will evolve as project patterns and preferences become more established.
