# Active Context: AmpX Energy Gateway

## Current Focus
The current development focus is on codebase modularization for maintainability. The shared Modbus functions have been moved to a new file, ampx_functions_modbus.ino. Further modularization is planned for network, API, meter, and web functions.

## Recent Changes
- Moved all shared Modbus functions (register conversion, processRegisters) to ampx_functions_modbus.ino
- Verified removal from original file
- Outlined next steps for modularizing network, API, meter, and web functions

## Next Steps
1. Create new files for network, API, meter, and web functions
2. Move corresponding functions to their new files
3. Test and verify all functionality after each move
4. Update documentation and Memory Bank after each major change

## Current Implementation Status
- Modbus functions now modularized
- Main codebase still contains network, API, meter, and web functions (to be moved)

## Active Decisions
- Adopt a modular file structure for maintainability and clarity

## Timeline Considerations
- Continue modularization in next session
- Test after each refactor step
- Keep Memory Bank and documentation in sync

This document will be updated as modularization progresses.
