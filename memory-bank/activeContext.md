# Active Context: AmpX Energy Gateway

## Current Focus
The current development focus is on optimizing the existing AmpX Energy Gateway implementation, addressing potential issues, and enhancing reliability.

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank structure with core documentation
- Completed codebase review of existing implementation
- Updated project scope based on clarified requirements
- Discovered that the project already has a working implementation
- Optimized JSON document size by switching to DynamicJsonDocument with increased capacity
- Identified but deferred String optimization for future implementation

## Next Steps
1. Continue optimizing specific areas of code:
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Security enhancements for credentials
   - Memory usage optimization
   - Performance improvements for multi-meter support
2. Implement comprehensive testing
   - Test with multiple meters
   - Validate both RS485 and TCP/IP variants
   - Stress test data collection and transmission
3. Address TODOs in the codebase
   - API credentials storage
   - Improve meter serial number handling
   - Clean up commented code

## Current Implementation Status
- Basic architecture is in place and working
- RS485 and TCP/IP communication implemented
- Web interface with WebSocket updates working
- API upload functionality implemented
- JSON document size optimized
- Multi-meter support implemented

## Active Decisions
- **JSON Document Approach**: Switched from StaticJsonDocument to DynamicJsonDocument for better memory management
- **String Optimization**: Deferred for future to maintain code simplicity at present
- **Optimization Priority**: Focusing on high-impact, low-effort optimizations first

## Open Questions
- What is the expected peak load (number of meters & frequency) in production?
- Are there specific security requirements for production deployment?
- What metrics are most important for monitoring system health?
- Should error handling be more aggressive (auto-restart) or passive (log-only)?

## Timeline Considerations
- Focus on optimizations that don't require major architectural changes
- Test each optimization independently
- Document all optimizations for future maintenance

This document will be updated regularly as development progresses and context evolves.
