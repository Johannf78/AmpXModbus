# Progress: AmpX Energy Gateway

## Completed Work
- ✅ Set up Memory Bank documentation structure
- ✅ Created initial project documentation:
  - Project Brief
  - Product Context
  - System Patterns
  - Technical Context
  - Active Context
- ✅ Completed codebase review and evaluation
- ✅ Updated project documentation based on clarified requirements
- ✅ Discovered that project is already implemented, pivoted to optimization
- ✅ Conducted detailed code review with optimization recommendations
- ✅ Implemented first optimization: increased JSON document capacity with DynamicJsonDocument
- ✅ Unified Modbus handler for RS485 and TCP/IP
- ✅ Modular initialization for NVS, WiFi, and NTP
- ✅ Dual API integration (WordPress and Docker API)
- ✅ Status LEDs for real-time feedback

## Current Status
The project has a robust, unified implementation for the AmpX Energy Gateway. The code supports both RS485 and TCP/IP communication, auto-detects meters, processes and uploads data to multiple APIs, and provides real-time feedback via LEDs and web interface. Focus is now on optimization, maintainability, and moving settings to persistent storage.

## In Progress
- 🔄 Moving API endpoints and credentials to persistent storage/web admin
- 🔄 Optimizing string handling and memory usage
- 🔄 Cleaning up legacy/commented code
- 🔄 Improving error handling and recovery

## Upcoming Work
- 📋 Implement security enhancements (credential management)
- 📋 Expand multi-meter support and test with more meters
- 📋 Comprehensive testing and documentation

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Unified Modbus handler
- ✅ Robust initialization and connectivity
- ✅ Multi-meter support (currently up to 4, architecture supports more)
- ✅ Web interface and WebSocket updates
- ✅ Dual API upload functionality
- ✅ Status LEDs for system state
- ❌ Credentials/settings not yet in persistent storage
- ❌ Some legacy/commented code remains
- ❌ String handling not yet optimized

## Known Issues
- Credentials and API endpoints are hardcoded
- Heavy use of String objects may cause memory fragmentation
- Some redundant/legacy code remains
- Error handling can be further improved
