# Progress: AmpX Energy Gateway

## Completed Work
- ✅ Set up Memory Bank documentation structure
- ✅ Created initial project documentation:
  - Project Brief
  - Product Context
  - System Patterns
  - Technical Context
  - Active Context
- ✅ Completed codebase review and evaluation
- ✅ Updated project documentation based on clarified requirements
- ✅ Discovered that project is already implemented, pivoted to optimization
- ✅ Conducted detailed code review with optimization recommendations
- ✅ Implemented first optimization: increased JSON document capacity with DynamicJsonDocument

## Current Status
The project has a working implementation of the AmpX Energy Gateway. The code supports both RS485 and TCP/IP communication with Meatrol Brand meters, data collection from multiple meters, a web interface with real-time updates, and API integration. Our focus has shifted from implementation to optimization, with initial improvements already applied.

## In Progress
- 🔄 Addressing high-priority optimizations from code review
- 🔄 Exploring error handling improvements

## Upcoming Work
- 📋 Implement security enhancements (credential management)
- 📋 Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
- 📋 Optimize memory usage (String objects, etc.)
- 📋 Enhance performance for multi-meter support
- 📋 Conduct comprehensive testing
- 📋 Clean up code (remove commented sections, consolidate duplication)
- 📋 Update documentation for deployment and maintenance

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Basic architecture in place and functioning
- ✅ RS485 communication module working
- ✅ TCP/IP communication module working
- ✅ Multi-meter support (up to 32 meters)
- ✅ Web interface with real-time updates
- ✅ API upload functionality
- ✅ JSON document capacity optimized
- ❌ Security for credentials not optimized
- ❌ Memory usage from String objects not optimized
- ❌ Some redundant code remains

## Known Issues
- Security: Credentials in code (WiFi passwords, API keys)
- Memory: Heavy use of String objects can lead to fragmentation
- Error handling: Limited recovery mechanisms for failures
- Daily restart mechanism indicates potential memory leaks
- Multiple global variables increase risk of side effects

## Milestones
| Milestone | Status | Target Date |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Memory Bank Setup | ✅ Completed | - |
| Codebase Evaluation | ✅ Completed | - |
| Implementation Evaluation | ✅ Completed | - |
| Initial Optimization (JSON doc) | ✅ Completed | - |
| Security Enhancements | 📋 Planned | - |
| Memory Optimization | 📋 Planned | - |

| Comprehensive Testing | 📋 Planned | - |

## Notes
The project scope has fundamentally changed from "we need to implement this" to "we need to optimize an existing implementation." This offers a more efficient path forward as we can focus on enhancing specific aspects of the working system rather than building from scratch.
