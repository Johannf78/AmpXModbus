# Product Context: AmpX Energy Gateway

## Problem Statement
Energy monitoring in industrial and commercial settings requires reliable data collection from meters and integration with management systems. Many existing solutions lack flexibility in supporting both RS485 and TCP/IP based meters, or they require complex setup and configuration.

## Solution
The AmpX Energy Gateway provides a hardware solution that connects to Meatrol Brand energy meters via either Modbus TCP/IP or Modbus RS485 (based on hardware configuration). It collects meter data, presents it in a simple web interface, and transmits it to a central API for further processing and analysis.

## User Experience Goals
- Provide a plug-and-play solution for energy monitoring
- Display real-time energy data in a simple tabular format
- Enable automated data collection without user intervention
- Support multiple meters (up to 32) for comprehensive monitoring

## Use Cases
1. **Industrial Energy Monitoring**: Factories monitor energy consumption across multiple meters
2. **Commercial Building Management**: Building operators track energy usage in different zones
3. **Energy Auditing**: Energy auditors collect standardized data from multiple measurement points
4. **Remote Monitoring**: Central monitoring of distributed energy meters

## Value Proposition
- Eliminates the need for manual meter reading
- Supports both TCP/IP and RS485 meters (with appropriate hardware)
- Provides real-time visibility through local web interface
- Automates data collection for centralized analysis
- Supports multi-meter installations for comprehensive energy management

## Market Context
The solution addresses the growing need for automated energy monitoring in industrial and commercial settings, particularly where multiple measurement points need to be consolidated into a single system.
